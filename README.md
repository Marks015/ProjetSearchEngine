# Project 2024

The main goal of this project is to create a search engine.
You will found 2~000 documents from french wikipedia, with 50 queries.

## Work to do

Code and create a search engine (index and reverse index) the matching model (between a query and documents).
You can use classical TF-iDF approache, vector approaches, or combine both of them.

It is forbidden to use frameworks such as ElasticSearch, Vespa, etc. You need to code your own search engine.

### Data provided

There is a set of queries in the ```requetes.jsonl``` file, which is a json-line file type. There is one query per line like this:
```{"Answer file": "wiki_042186.txt", "Queries": ["course à pied", "trail"]}```
Each query correspond to an answer file, this means when you perform a query, you should have as answer the right file.
All data files are in a set of documents stored in the follolwing zip file : ```wiki_split_extract_2k.zip```.



## Things to send back

At the end of the project, you will send me by email a report that contains :

- A report explaining what you have done (≃ 5-10 pages + references)
- I want you to write a report. This also means you have to put your name on it and to do an effort of presentation! ;-)
- upload the report in teams before the deadline (github / gitlab accepted)
- No Jupiternote !!!
- ready-to-work script (in python or demonstration) (github / gitlab accepted)
- a link to download the model if you created one (github / gitlab accepted)
- 1 report per group (do not upload one report per student)
- If you send me your report lately, you will be penalised
